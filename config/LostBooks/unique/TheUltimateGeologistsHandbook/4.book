The Ultimate Geologists Handbook: Clouds

   While most ore is found in veins, it is very hard to meet a very large ore goal by individually hunting down veins and clearing them out. Luckily there are huge somewhat diffuse pockets of rich ore to be found in the world. These ore "clouds" are very rare, but once found, if is extremely profitable to set of a base of operations in their area until you hollow them out. As rare as they are, it may seem impossible to find a specific variety of ore cloud, but luckily specific ores only form clouds in certain climates. By targeting specific climates, one can narrow their search by three-fold.
