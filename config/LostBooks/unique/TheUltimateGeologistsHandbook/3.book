The Ultimate Geologists Handbook: Veins

   Not all stone has is enriched with ore, and the stone that is isn't just liberally sprinkled throughout the depth of the world. Most ore is found in long "veins" twisting through the barren stone. Veins are found of all lengths and extend anywhere from the tallest mountains to the impenetrable bedrock below. However, it appears that each variety of ore has a common depth of origin. This is the most important secret of profitable mining. By the Addition Theorm for Probability, mining at the common depth of origin for the ore you are looking for will increase one's chances of finding an ore vein by two-fold.
