Variant Ore Deposits
Prospector
You may find a single block of ore that doesn't seem to be connected to a vein at all.  If you do, consider yourself lucky. You are near a large deposit of ore.

The best way to find this deposit is probably to use branch mining to find the direction the scattered ore becomes more dense.
