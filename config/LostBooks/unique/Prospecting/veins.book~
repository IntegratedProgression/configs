Prospecting: Part 1
Anonymous
Most ore occurs in long, windy veins.


"Strip Mining," or exploratory mining, is useful to find these veins.  It should not be used to harvest them, as this is much less efficient than simply following the vein.  If a vein seems to stop, dig out a wider area around it to be sure before you resume exporatory mining.
